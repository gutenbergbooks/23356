    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as I was passing through Boston Common, which lies between my
      home and my office, I met a gentleman lounging along The Mall. I am
      generally preoccupied when walking, and often thread my way through
      crowded streets without distinctly observing any one. But this man's face
      forced itself upon me, and a singular face it was. His eyes were faded,
      and his hair, which he wore long, was flecked with gray. His hair and
      eyes, if I may say so, were sixty years old, the rest of him not thirty.
      The youthfulness of his figure, the elasticity of his gait, and the
      venerable appearance of his head were incongruities that drew more than
      one pair of curious eyes towards him, He excited in me the painful
      suspicion that he had got either somebody else's head or somebody else's
      body. He was evidently an American, at least so far as the upper part of
      him was concerned&mdash;the New England cut of countenance is unmistakable&mdash;evidently
      a man who had seen something of the world, but strangely young and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before reaching the Park Street gate, I had taken up the thread of thought
      which he had unconsciously broken; yet throughout the day this old young
      man, with his unwrinkled brow and silvered locks, glided in like a phantom
      between me and my duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I again encountered him on The Mall. He was resting
      lazily on the green rails, watching two little sloops in distress, which
      two ragged ship-owners had consigned to the mimic perils of the Pond. The
      vessels lay becalmed in the middle of the ocean, displaying a tantalizing
      lack of sympathy with the frantic helplessness of the owners on shore. As
      the gentleman observed their dilemma, a light came into his faded eyes,
      then died out leaving them drearier than before. I wondered if he, too, in
      his time, had sent out ships that drifted and drifted and never came to
      port; and if these poor toys were to him types of his own losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man has a story, and I should like to know it,&rdquo; I said, half aloud,
      halting in one of those winding paths which branch off from the pastoral
      quietness of the Pond, and end in the rush and tumult of Tremont Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; exclaimed a voice at my side. I turned and faced Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      a neighbor of mine, who laughed heartily at finding me talking to myself.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, reflectingly, &ldquo;I can tell you this man's story; and if
      you will match the narrative with anything as curious, I shall be glad to
      hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no. That is to say, I do not know him personally; but I know a
      singular passage in his life. I happened to be in Paris when he was
      buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, strictly speaking, not buried; but something quite like it. If you
      've a spare half hour,&rdquo; continued my friend H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;we
      'll sit on this bench, and I will tell you all I know of an affair that
      made some noise in Paris a couple of years ago. The gentleman himself,
      standing yonder, will serve as a sort of frontispiece to the romance&mdash;a
      full-page illustration, as it were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following pages contain the story Which Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      related to me. While he was telling it, a gentle wind arose; the miniature
      sloops drifted feebly about the ocean; the wretched owners flew from point
      to point, as the deceptive breeze promised to waft the barks to either
      shore; the early robins trilled now and then from the newly fringed elms;
      and the old young man leaned on the rail in the sunshine, little dreaming
      that two gossips were discussing his affairs within twenty yards of him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Three persons were sitting in a <i>salon</i> whose one large window
      overlooked the Place Vendôme. M. Dorine, with his back half turned on the
      other two occupants of the apartment, was reading the Journal des Débats
      in an alcove, pausing from time to time to wipe his glasses, and taking
      scrupulous pains not to glance towards the lounge at his right, on which
      were seated Mile. Dorine and a young American gentleman, whose handsome
      face rather frankly told his position in the family. There was not a
      happier man in Paris that afternoon than Philip Wentworth. Life had become
      so delicious to him that he shrunk from looking beyond to-day. What could
      the future add to his full heart, what might it not take away? The deepest
      joy has always something of melancholy in it&mdash;a presentiment, a
      fleeting sadness, a feeling without a name. Wentworth was conscious of
      this subtile shadow that night, when he rose from the lounge and
      thoughtfully held Julie's hand to his lip for a moment before parting. A
      careless observer would not have thought him, as he was, the happiest man
      in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Dorine laid down his paper, and came forward. &ldquo;If the house,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;is such as M. Cherbonneau describes it, I advise you to close with him at
      once. I would accompany you, Philip, but the truth is, I am too sad at
      losing this little bird to assist you in selecting a cage for her.
      Remember, the last train for town leaves at five. Be sure not to miss it;
      for we have seats for Sardou's new comedy to-morrow night. By to-morrow
      night,&rdquo; he added laughingly, &ldquo;little Julie here will be an old lady&mdash;it
      is such an age from now until then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the train bore Philip to one of the loveliest spots
      within thirty miles of Paris. An hour's walk through green lanes brought
      him to M. Cherbonueau's estate. In a kind of dream the young man wandered
      from room to room, inspected the conservatory, the stables, the lawns, the
      strip of woodland through which a merry brook sang to itself continually,
      and, after dining with M. Cherbonneau, completed the purchase, and turned
      his steps towards the station just in time to catch the express train.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Paris stretched out before him, with its lights twinkling in the early
      dusk, and its spires and domes melting into the evening air, it seemed to
      Philip as if years had elapsed since he left the city. On reaching Paris
      he drove to his hôtel, where he found several letters lying on the table.
      He did not trouble himself even to glance at their superscriptions as he
      threw aside his travelling surtout for a more appropriate dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, in his impatience to return to Mile. Dorine, the cars had appeared to
      walk, the fiacre, which he had secured at the station appeared to creep.
      At last it turned into the Place Vendôme, and drew up before M. Dorine's
      hôtel. The door opened as Philip's foot touched the first step. The valet
      silently took his cloak and hat, with a special deference, Philip thought;
      but was he not now one of the family?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M. Dorine,&rdquo; said the servant slowly, &ldquo;is unable to see Monsieur at
      present. He wishes Monsieur to be shown up to the salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mademoiselle&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, Monsieur,&rdquo; repeated the man, looking curiously at Philip, who
      could scarcely repress an exclamation of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that such a privilege had been accorded him. His
      interviews with Julie had always taken place in the presence of M. Dorine,
      or some member of the household. A well-bred Parisian girl has but a
      formal acquaintance with her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not linger on the staircase; with a light heart, he went up the
      steps, two at a time, hastened through the softly lighted hall, in which
      he detected the faint scent of her favorite flowers, and stealthily opened
      the door of the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was darkened. Underneath the chandelier stood a slim black casket
      on trestles. A lighted candle, a crucifix, and some white flowers were on
      a table near by. Julie Dorine was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When M. Dorine heard the sudden cry that rang through the silent house, he
      hurried from the library, and found Philip standing like a ghost in the
      middle of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until long afterwards that Wentworth learned the details of the
      calamity that had befallen him. On the previous night Mile. Dorine had
      retired to her room in seemingly perfect health, and had dismissed her
      maid with a request to be awakened early the next morning. At the
      appointed hour the girl entered the chamber. Mile. Dorine was sitting in
      an arm-chair, apparently asleep. The candle in the <i>bougeoir</i> had
      burnt down to the socket; a book lay half open on the carpet at her feet.
      The girl started when she saw that the bed had not been occupied, and that
      her mistress still wore an evening dress. She rushed to Mile. Dorine's
      side. It was not slumber; it was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two messages were at once despatched to Philip, one to the station at G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      the other to his hôtel. The first missed him on the road, the second he
      had neglected to open. On his arrival at M. Dorine's house, the valet,
      under the supposition that Wentworth had been advised of Mile. Dorine's
      death, broke the intelligence with awkward cruelty, by showing him
      directly to the salon. Mile. Dorine's wealth, her beauty, the suddenness
      of her death, and the romance that had in some way attached itself to her
      love for the young American drew crowds to witness the funeral ceremonies,
      which took place in the church in the Rue d'Aguesseau. The body was to be
      laid in M. Dorine's tomb, in the cemetery of Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tomb requires a few words of description. First there was a grating
      of filigraned iron; through this you looked into a small vestibule or
      hall, at the end of which was a massive door of oak opening upon a short
      flight of stone steps descending into the tomb. The vault was fifteen or
      twenty feet square, ingeniously ventilated from the ceiling, but
      unlighted. It contained two sarcophagi: the first held the remains of
      Madame Dorine, long since dead; the other was new, and bore on one side
      the letters J. D., in monogram, interwoven with fleurs-de-lis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral train stopped at the gate of the small garden that enclosed
      the place of burial, only the immediate relatives follow-ing the bearers
      into the tomb. A slender wax candle, such as is used in Catholic churches,
      burnt at the foot of the uncovered sarcophagus, casting a dim glow oyer
      the centre of the apartment, and deepening the shadows which seemed to
      huddle together in the corners. By this flickering light the coffin was
      placed in its granite shell, the heavy slab laid over it reverently, and
      the oaken door swung on its rusty hinges, shutting out the uncertain ray
      of sunshine that had ventured to peep in on the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Dorine, muffled in his cloak, threw himself on the back seat of the
      landau, too abstracted in his grief to observe that he was the only
      occupant of the vehicle. There was a sound of wheels grating on the
      gravelled avenue, and then all was silence again in the cemetery of
      Montmartre. At the main entrance the carriages parted company, dashing off
      into various streets at a pace that seemed to express a sense of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattle of wheels had died out of the air when Philip opened his eyes,
      bewildered, like a man abruptly roused from slumber. He raised himself on
      one arm and stared into the surrounding blackness. Where was he? In a
      second the truth flashed upon him. He had been left in the tomb! While
      kneeling on the farther side of the stone box, perhaps he had fainted, and
      during the last solemn rites his absence had been unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first emotion was one of natural terror. But this passed as quickly as
      it came. Life had ceased to be so very precious to him; and if it were his
      fate to die at Julie's side, was not that the fulfilment of the desire
      which he had expressed to himself a hundred times that morning? What did
      it matter, a few years sooner or later? He must lay down the burden at
      last. Why not then? A pang of self-reproach followed they thought. Could
      he so lightly throw aside the love that had bent over his cradle. The
      sacred name of mother rose involuntarily to his lips. Was it not cowardly
      to yield up without a struggle the life when he should guard for her sake?
      Was it not his duty to the living and the dead to face the difficulties of
      his position, and overcome them if it were within human power?
    </p>
    <p>
      With an organization as delicate as a woman's he had that spirit which,
      however sluggish in repose, leaps with a kind of exultation to measure its
      strength with disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vague fear of the supernatural, that would affect most men in a
      similar situation, found no room in his heart. He was simply shut in a
      chamber from which it was necessary that he should obtain release within a
      given period. That this chamber contained the body of the woman he loved,
      so far from adding to the terror of the case, was a circumstance from
      which he drew consolation. She was a beautiful white statue now. Her soul
      was far hence; and if that pure spirit could return, would it not be to
      shield him with her love? It was impossible that the place should not
      engender some thought of the kind. He did not put the thought entirely
      from him as he rose to his feet and stretched out his hands in the
      darkness; but his mind was too healthy and practical to indulge long in
      such speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, being a smoker, chanced to have in his pocket a box of <i>allumettes</i>.
      After several ineffectual essays, he succeeded in igniting one against the
      dank wall, and by its momentary glare perceived that the candle had been
      left in the tomb. This would serve him in examining the fastenings of the
      vault. If he could force the inner door by any means, and reach the
      grating, of which he had an indistinct recollection, he might hope to make
      himself heard. But the oaken door was immovable, as solid as the wall
      itself, into which it fitted air-tight. Even if he had had the requisite
      tools, there were no fastenings to be removed; the hinges were set on the
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having ascertained this, Philip replaced the candle on the floor, and
      leaned against the wall thoughtfully, watching the blue fan of flame that
      wavered to and fro, threatening to detach itself from the wick. &ldquo;At all
      events,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the place is ventilated.&rdquo; Suddenly he sprang forward
      and extinguished the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      His existence depended on that candle! He had read somewhere, in some
      account of shipwreck, how the survivors had lived for days upon a few
      candles which one of the passengers had insanely thrown into the
      long-boat. And here he had been burning away his very life!
    </p>
    <p>
      By the transient illumination of one of the tapers, he looked at his
      watch. It had stopped at eleven&mdash;but eleven that day, or the
      preceding night? The funeral, he knew, had left the church at ten. How
      many hours had passed since then? Of what duration had been his swoon?
      Alas! it was no longer possible for him to measure those hours which crawl
      like snails by the wretched, and fly like swallows over the happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the candle, and seated himself on the stone steps. He was a
      sanguine man, but, as he weighed the chances of escape, the prospect
      appalled him. Of course he would be missed. His disappearance under the
      circumstances would surely alarm his friends; they would institute a
      search for him; but who would think of searching for a live man in the
      cemetery of Montmartre? The préfet of police would set a hundred
      intelligences at work to find him; the Seine might be dragged, <i>les
      misérables</i> turned over at the Morgue; a minute description of him
      would be in every detective's pocket; and he&mdash;in M. Dorine's family
      tomb!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, on the other hand, it was here, he was last seen; from this point a
      keen detective would naturally work up the case. Then might not the
      undertaker return for the candlestick, probably not left by design? Or,
      again, might not M. Dorine send fresh wreaths of flowers, to take the
      place of those which now diffused a pungent, aromatic odor throughout the
      chamber? Ah! what unlikely chances! But if one of these things did not
      happen speedily, it had better never happen. How long could he keep life
      in himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      With his pocket-knife Wentworth cut the half-burned candle into four equal
      parts. &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; he meditated, &ldquo;I will eat the first of these pieces;
      to-morrow, the second; to-morrow evening, the third; the next day, the
      fourth; and then&mdash;then I 'll wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had taken no breakfast that morning, unless a cup of coffee can be
      called a breakfast. He had never been very hungry before. He was
      ravenously hungry now. But he postponed the meal as long as practicable.
      It must have been near midnight, according to his calculation, when he
      determined to try the first of his four singular repasts. The bit of
      white-wax was tasteless; but it served its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appetite for the time appeased, he found a new discomfort. The
      humidity of the walls, and the wind that crept through the unseen
      ventilator, chilled him to the bone. To keep walking was his only
      resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      A kind of drowsiness, too, occasionally came over him. It took all his
      will to fight it off. To sleep, he felt, was to die, and he had made up
      his mind to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest fancies flitted through his head as he groped up and down
      the stone floor of the dungeon, feeling his way along the wall to avoid
      the sepulchres. Voices that had long been silent spoke words that had long
      been forgotten; faces he had known in childhood grew palpable against the
      dark. His whole life in detail was unrolled before him like a panorama;
      the changes of a year, with its burden of love and death, its sweets and
      its bitternesses, were epitomized in a single second. The desire to sleep
      had left him, but the keen hunger came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be near morning now,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;perhaps the sun is just gilding
      the towers of Notre Dame; or, may be, a dull, drizzling rain is beating on
      Paris, sobbing on these mounds above me. Paris! it seems like a dream. Did
      I ever walk in its gay boulevards in the golden air? Oh, the delight and
      pain and passion of that sweet human life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip became conscious that the gloom, the silence, and the cold were
      gradually conquering him. The feverish activity of his brain brought on a
      reaction. He grew lethargic; he sunk down on the steps, and thought of
      nothing. His hand fell by chance on one of the pieces of candle; he
      grasped it and devoured it mechanically. This revived him. &ldquo;How strange,&rdquo;
       he thought, &ldquo;that I am not thirsty. Is it possible that the dampness of
      the walls, which I must inhale with every breath, has supplied the need of
      water? Not a drop has passed my lips for two days, and still I experience
      no thirst. That drowsiness, thank Heaven, has gone. I think I was never
      wide awake until this hour. It would be an anodyne like poison that could
      weigh down my eyelids. No doubt the dread of sleep has something to do
      with this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minutes were like hours. Now he walked as briskly as he dared up and
      down the tomb; now he rested against the door. More than once he was
      tempted to throw himself upon the stone coffin that held Julie, and make
      no further struggle for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one piece of candle remained. He had eaten the third portion, not to
      satisfy hunger, but from a precautionary motive he had taken it as a man
      takes some disagreeable drug upon the result of which hangs safety. The
      time was rapidly approaching when even this poor substitute for
      nourishment would be exhausted. He delayed that moment. He gave himself a
      long fast this time. The half-inch of candle which he held in his hand was
      a sacred thing to him. It was his last defence against death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, with such a sinking at heart as he had not known before, he
      raised it to his lips. Then he paused, then he hurled the fragment across
      the tomb, then the oaken door was flung open, and Philip, with dazzled
      eyes, saw M. Dorine's form sharply defined against the blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they led him out, half blinded, into the broad daylight, M. Dorine
      noticed that Philip's hair, which a short time since was as black as a
      crow's wing, had actually turned gray in places. The man's eyes, too, had
      faded; the darkness had dimmed their lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long was he really confined in the tomb?&rdquo; I asked, as Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      concluded the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Just one hour and twenty minutes!</i>&rdquo; replied Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      smiling blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the Lilliputian sloops, with their sails all blown out like
      white roses, came floating bravely into port, and Philip Wentworth lounged
      by us, wearily, in the pleasant April sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s narrative haunted me. Here was a man who had
      undergone a strange ordeal. Here was a man whose sufferings were unique.
      His was no threadbare experience. Eighty minutes had seemed like two days
      to him! If he had really been immured two days in the tomb, the story,
      from my point of view, would have lost its tragic value.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this it was natural that I should regard Mr. Wentworth with
      stimulated curiosity. As I met him from day to day, passing through the
      Common with that same introspective air, there was something in his
      loneliness which touched me. I wondered that I had not read before in his
      pale, meditative face some such sad history as Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      had confided to me. I formed the resolution of speaking to him, though
      with no very lucid purpose. One morning we came face to face at the
      intersection of two paths. He halted courteously to allow me the
      precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Wentworth,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name, sir,&rdquo; he said, in an off-hand manner, &ldquo;is Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jo-Jo-Jones!&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not Joseph Jones,&rdquo; he returned, with a glacial air&mdash;&ldquo;Frederick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dim light, in which the perfidy of my friend H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was
      becoming discernible, began to break upon my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will probably be a standing wonder to Mr. Frederick Jones why a strange
      man accosted him one morning on the Common as &ldquo;Mr. Wentworth,&rdquo; and then
      dashed madly down the nearest foot-path and disappeared in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, I had been duped by Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who is a
      gentleman of literary proclivities, and has, it is whispered, become
      somewhat demented in brooding over the Great American Novel&mdash;not yet
      hatched, He had actually tried the effect of one of his chapters on me!
    </p>
    <p>
      My hero, as I subsequently learned, is a commonplace young person, who had
      some connection, I know not what, with the building of that graceful
      granite bridge which spans the crooked silver lake in the Public Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think of the readiness with which Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; built
      up his airy fabric on my credulity, I feel half inclined to laugh, though
      I am deeply mortified at having been the unresisting victim of his Black
      Art.
